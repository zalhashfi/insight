# Build pipeline that deploys upstream source, not the local clone's code.
# Invoked by deploy/wrangler.toml's [build] command via the bootstrap
# one-liner that curls this file from upstream master.
#
# Why: the Deploy to Cloudflare button creates a clone of this repo's deploy/
# subdir in the user's account. Without this script, that clone would be the
# source of truth — meaning code changes in upstream never reach them. With
# this script, every deploy:
#
#   1. Replaces every file with the upstream source's contents.
#   2. Rebuilds wrangler.toml from upstream's carrier template, keeping only the
#      deployment's identity (Worker name, account, routes, resource IDs, vars).
#      Keeping the whole file instead froze the topology at day 1, so a binding
#      or flag added upstream never reached anyone who had already deployed.
#   3. Runs upstream's build pipeline.
#
# Result: the user's clone is functionally a config carrier. Code = upstream.
#
# Which upstream ref is pulled depends on NODRIX_DEPLOY_CHANNEL:
#   - release (default): the latest published GitHub release. Production.
#   - edge:              default-branch HEAD. For the maintainer's dev instance.
#
# Local development is unaffected: this script only runs when
# WORKERS_CI_COMMIT_SHA is set, which Cloudflare Workers Builds populates
# in CI. Locally, `bun run build` calls the workspace scripts directly and
# doesn't touch this file.

# 3. Overlay upstream onto the local working tree IN-PLACE. Critical: do NOT
#    rm-rf and recreate directories. The outer `bun run --filter @nodrix/worker
#    build` process is holding a CWD inside worker/, and the wrangler subprocess
#    it spawned is what's running THIS script. If we wipe worker/ and recreate
#    it, those processes end up with a CWD pointing to a deleted inode — wrangler
#    silently hangs on its next filesystem op. `cp -Rf src/. dst` overwrites
#    files in place (including read-only ones via -f) without touching the
#    parent inode.
cp -Rf "${UPSTREAM_DIR}"/. .

# 3b. Mirror upstream DELETIONS. `cp -Rf` only adds/overwrites, so a file the
#     upstream renamed or deleted (e.g. a removed Vue page) lingers in an existing
#     deployment's tree — and since the build typechecks the whole src tree
#     (vue-tsc), an orphan referencing now-removed code breaks the build. Delete
#     any source file upstream no longer has. We remove individual FILES only,
#     never a directory, so the worker/ CWD inode the parent process holds stays
#     valid.
#
#     `internal/` is deliberately NOT in this list: it's a git submodule
#     (promo + test-clients + dev docs) that the --depth=1 upstream clone does
#     not recurse, so it never carries deploy-relevant source. The worker+web
#     build chain doesn't touch it.
